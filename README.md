# Interview: IVR Test

This is a sample application I built when interviewing for a San Francisco-based tech company. The purpose of the application was to be a very light PoC for use in a call center. During a call, a customer service (CS) agent would trigger their IVR to prompt the caller to enter sensitive data, via touchtone (aka their phone keypad). This allows customer service to collect sensitive data over the phone, like credit card number, without making the data directly accessible to the CS agent.

This was hacked together in a few hours and is far from production ready. It's probably not a great showcase of my skills, but I figured there was no point in keeping the repo private.
